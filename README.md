# Assembled list of Fido AAGUIDs 
The AAGUID, short for "Authenticator Attestation Globally Unique Identifier" is part of the FIDO2 specification. The AAGUID (in most cases) identifies the authenticator _make and model_. As such it allows the Relying Party (RP) or Identity Provider (IdP) a simple way to include (or exclude) authenticators during registration/enrollment and authentication without for example implementing the Fido Metadata Service.
