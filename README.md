# Assembled list of Fido AAGUIDs 
The AAGUID, short for "Authenticator Attestation Globally Unique Identifier" is part of the FIDO2 specification. The AAGUID (in most cases) identifies the authenticator _make and model_. As such it allows the Relying Party (RP) or Identity Provider (IdP) a simple way to include (or exclude) authenticators during registration/enrollment and authentication without for example implementing the Fido Metadata Service.

The [file](https://github.com/JMarkstrom/fido/blob/main/Add-Kerberos-object-to-AAD.ps1) `Add-Kerberos-object-to-AAD.ps1` PowerShell script is designed to establish an Azure AD Kerberos Server object within your on-premise AD, enabling seamless FIDO2 (SSO) access to on-premise resources like network shares. It's important to note that this isn't mandatory for FIDO2 security key sign-in, but it does broaden the scope of security key utilization beyond PC login.
